Here are a few training videos with their associated setups and functions:

#### Playing Chicken
This was one of our first approaches at a multi-network system. We were quite surprised when a majority of the training samples showed a single agent on the planet. Originally starting as a strategy to spread out. This agent learned to run from other agents, and wait for the others to fall, before running a mad dash in order to survive.

Reward function
-1 for falling off the planet
0.1 each frame for staying on
Additional 0.1 per frame if the planetâ€™s angular velocity is slower than the last time reward was calculated

#### Dancing and afraid

This is one of our last attempts at Single-Network Training.
Agents Seem to dance around the top of the planet. Placement of the Mcguffin causes them to stop dancing, and clump together in "fear".  They then step away from the mcguffin slowly. 

Reward function:
+.1 per frame for surviving
+.1 per frame for slowing down the planet (reducing angular speed)
-1 for dying
+1 per frame during a consume state
